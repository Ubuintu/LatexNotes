	\section{High-level View of Unix Environment}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To best understand how an operating system works, keep in mind the concept of abstraction.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Abstraction focuses on the basic purpose and operation of an object.
		\end{itemize}
		% Example of bolded text
		\item There are many times for an abstracted subdivision in software. In these notes, the term {\bf component} 
		\item This chapter provides a high-level overview of the components that make up a Linux system.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Levels and Layers of Abstraction in Linux}
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Abstraction helps break down the Linux operating system into easy-to-understand components.
		
		\item We arrange components into layers or levels, classifications or groupings of components according to where the components lay between the user and hardware.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item i.e. Web browsers, games, etc. are at the top layer; the bottom layer consists of the memory in hardware which is composed of 0's and 1's.
		\end{itemize}
	
		\item A Linux OS consists of 3 main levels:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item The base consists of hardware:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Hardware includes the memory as well as the Central Processing Unit(s) to perform computation or RD/WR to memory.
					\item Devices such as disks and network interfaces are also part of the hardware.
				\end{itemize}
			
			\item The next level up is the kernel:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The kernal is consider the software within memory that tells the CPU where to look for its next task.
					\item As a mediator, the kernal manages hardware (i.e. main memory) and is the primary interface between hardware and any running program.
				\end{itemize}
			
			\item Processes:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Running programs that are managed by the kernal, make up the system's upper level known as {\bf user space} (i.e. all web servers run as user processes).
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
